                      ---- A simple, monolithic kernel for the BXS/86 Operating System. ----
Kernel created for the BXS/86 operating system. Supports x86_64 architecture only. It has a BSD-like API, support for many file systems and much more. Can render VGA graphics and eight-bit full graphics. Able to work on devices with modern processors. Unix-like kernel. There is full support for ext4 and USB ports.

The kernel is currently in alpha testing, and for now, the "make iso" command has been added to the kernel Makefile. This command compiles the kernel into an ISO image for quick testing. For those waiting for the full BXS/86, this isn't a full version at all, but merely a test kernel with a simple boot.asm and grub bootloader. This won't be included in BXS/86.
