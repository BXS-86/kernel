                      ---- A simple, monolithic kernel for the BXS/86 Operating System. ----
Kernel created for the BXS/86 operating system. Supports x86_64 architecture only. It has a BSD-like API, support for many file systems and much more. Can render VGA graphics and eight-bit full graphics. Able to work on devices with modern processors. Unix-like kernel. There is full support for ext4 and USB ports.

The kernel is currently in alpha testing, and for now, the "make iso" command has been added to the kernel Makefile. This command compiles the kernel into an ISO image for quick testing. For those waiting for the full BXS/86, this isn't a full version at all, but merely a test kernel with a simple boot.asm and grub bootloader. This won't be included in BXS/86.

The kernel is compiled into an ELF file, which can later be used in a full-fledged operating system for booting. The project is licensed under the MIT license to ensure full open source availability of all components. Many system calls in this kernel are compatible with Linux, as they follow POSIX principles. The kernel uses a modular structure and static allocation of most resources. Currently, the kernel lacks full-fledged virtual memory and has a very simple scheduler, there's no real multiprocessing support. The drivers are in the kernel, but their operations aren't implemented. I hope all these kernel limitations will be fixed soon. The kernel already supports TTYs via Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6. Registered file systems: ext2/3/4, FAT/FAT32, NTFS, ISO9660, procfs, sysfs, tmpfs, devfs, ramfs, and will be used in the future.
